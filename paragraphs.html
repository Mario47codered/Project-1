<h1>Something</h1>

<p>
Start with your html tag and then add a title. Then add several paragraphs. Try different spacings like we practiced in the headings video to see how the browser will react. Remember, these are preset formats in the html. It has already been told how to treat a paragraph and will always do what it’s been told. Just remember that if you feel like it’s not listening to you. It’s got someone else who told it what to do.</p>



<h2>End of paragraph practice</h2>
